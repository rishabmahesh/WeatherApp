# WeatherApp
A mini project which tells you the weather

About:
This is a mini porject which was made using HTML, CSS, and JS which tells the user the weather based on searched places. I have used the Open Weather Map API which taught me a lot about using API calls, JSON objects, and debugging. It was also a great experience coding in HTML and CSS to make a basic website. Learning CSS from scratch, I self-taught myself the basic concepts and tried to use them in this project.
